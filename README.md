# fonish
A phonetic based language/alphabet using latin characters. Currently this is just an alphabet and doesn't have it's own words, but I am planning on developing some words at some point

# Spelling
The way you spell with this language is all phonetically. Try to sound out the words if you are having trouble.
Ex. 
```
Have you ever tried to eat chicken without your mouth?
```
```
Hav ju avar traid tu iat tšiken wiþout jor mouþ?
```
Spelling could differ depending on accent, or just how you pronounce the word.
