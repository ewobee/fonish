# Fonške
Fonške is a phonetic based conlang using the fonish alphabet. Suggest words for me to add if you would like to see them.

# Spelling
The way you spell with this language is all phonetically. Try to sound out the words if you are having trouble.
Ex. 
```
Have you ever tried to eat chicken without your mouth?
```
```
Hav ju avar traid tu iat tšiken wiþout jor mouþ?
```
You can try to spell things how they are pronounced with diacritics, but you can write without them, it just slightly changes how you pronounce it most of the time.

Spelling could differ depending on accent, or just how you pronounce the word.

Here is an example sentence in the Fonške language
```
Ji kare roi o šiare tšaka rovin ji lupe
```
# Tenses
Verbs change with present tense, past tense, and future tense.

All verbs have an infinitive form, for example, _O šia_ (To eat)

For any verb in present tense, you add a _-re_ to the end of the verb.
```
Šiare (šia + re
```
In past tense, you add a _-ke_
```
Šiake (šia + ke)
```
In future tense, you add a _-te_
```
Šiate (šia + te)
```
